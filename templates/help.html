        <ul class="mb-0">
            <li class="text large-text"><span class="notopia">Notopia</span> is your new favorite note-taking app that combines simplicity and ease of use with flexibility and features. It's a basic note-taking app that is designed to get out of your way and help you focus on what matters.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Without an account, you are limited to what I call "No-saving mode", where you can write a quick textual note without saving or any extra features. Think needing to just quickly write a piece of information that's only relevant for that very moment, such as small sequences of letters or numbers that you want to be able to easily see for a few minutes as you work with it without the need to save it. <span class="notopia">Notopia</span> Won't get in your way and force you to make an account just for that. Just work away!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">To access the rest of <span class="notopia">Notopia</span>'s multitude of features, a <span class="notopia">Notopia</span> account is required. It's free and easy to makeâ€”just choose a username and a password and you're off!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Creating a <span class="notopia">Notopia</span> account unlocks a wide range of features, such as the ability to save notes, use Markdown in your notes, choose note background colors, create and manage tags, and more!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">The <span class="notopia">Notopia</span> note editor is where you do all the note-taking. There, you can create new notes and view/edit existing ones. You can give each note a title and a body of text. Right-to-Left (RTL) languages are also supported and render properly.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">No need to worry about saving your notes in <span class="notopia">Notopia</span>! The note editor is equipped with an autosave function. Any single modification you make to the title, the body, or even the background color gets saved in a flash!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Below the Note body field in the editor, you can find a few tools to help you with note writing/editing and organization.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">The first two of these editor tools are the Undo and Redo tools, which work exactly as you would expect and make it easier for mobile users to access these functions without needing to use keyboard shortcuts like ctrl+z or ctrl+y, making their lives easier.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Then comes the Markdown View Toggler. Using this tool, you can toggle between the note body field (for editing) and Markdown View (for viewing Markdown). With the simple Markdown syntax, you can add a touch of formatting to your text, hyperlinks, images, and more! It's worth noting that Markdown is not specific to <span class="notopia">Notopia</span>. For more information about Markdown and its syntax, search for "Markdown" with your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Next to that is the Note Background Color Selector. It can be used to change the note's background color to any of 10 provided colors. It can be used for color-coding notes that have things in common, or it can be used to make notes more aesthetically pleasing according to your taste. The choice is yours, so get painting!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">And last but not least, the Delete Note tool. If you don't need a note anymore, you can use this tool to delete it from your account's database.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Next up is the "My notes" page. There, you can see a list of every note you have created, minus the ones you may have deleted. On this page, the notes appear in a lovely grid view, and you can even peek at their titles/bodies without having to open them. Note background colors also show up here, allowing you to color-code specific notes according to your needs. Clicking or tapping a note opens it in the editor for editing and viewing.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Each note has a checkbox on its top left corner. To select multiple notes, simply check the checkboxes of the notes you would like to select. This way, you can delete notes in bulk or link them to a tag or tags for organization (I'll explain tags below!). Pure time-saving here!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Your list of notes is sorted by creation date (descending) by default. Don't prefer that? No problem! Sort your notes as you like with the Sort tool at the top to help you get to what you need as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Your notes are sorted as you like. Still don't think it's enough? I've provided you with the Filter tool, which allows you to choose a tag or tags to only show the notes linked to them. Whether the note you're looking for is about work, entertainment, or family, it's as simple as choosing a tag or tags to show only the notes linked to them!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Finding notes has never been easier with the Search tool, which enables you to find a note based on text in its title or body. That's three tools to help you get to notes easier and increase your productivity. Three!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">After that is the "My tags" page, your hub for anything tags! With it, you can view your created tags and the notes linked with them, create new tags, rename existing tags, and delete the tags you no longer need.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">Tags can be thought of as folders where your notes can be grouped for organization, except a single note can be linked to multiple tags at the same time. A note about my son's health would go in both a "Family" tag and a "Health" tag for better organization. This way, I can filter my notes by a specific tag or tags (as explained above) for quick access to all the notes about a specific topic.</li>
            <li class="text large-text">If you feel the need to change your password or get a backup copy of the database file containing your notes and tags, head to "Account settings" and you won't be disappointed!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">That's about all you need to know to use <span class="notopia">Notopia</span>, the clean and simple web-based note-taking app. Feel free to explore around now and see how <span class="notopia">Notopia</span> is capable of helping you!</li>
            <li class="text large-text">This app was created by me (and me alone!) in 2024 for the CS50x Final Project. Wish me luck!</li>
